## What is Bluerage?

Bluerage transforms automation by combining the simplicity of visual workflows
with the intelligence of AI. Think of it as Apple Shortcuts enhanced with AI
capabilities - create agents that understand your goals, make decisions, and
execute complex tasks autonomously in the cloud.

## Key Features

### Mobile First

Designed from the ground up for iOS. Share content directly to your agents,
trigger workflows on the go, and manage automations from anywhere with a native
mobile experience.

### Bring Your Own Keys

Full control over your AI usage and costs. Connect your own API keys for OpenAI,
Anthropic, or other providers.

### Declarative Automation

Define your goal in natural language and let AI handle the complexity. Your
agents understand context, make decisions, and passes data between steps for
you. No node-based architecture!

### Cloud-Based Execution

Agents run in the cloud via Convex, continuing their work even after you close
the app. Start a task and come back to see the results.

### Tool Integration

Connect your existing applications and services through a growing library of
tools. Each agent can access multiple tools to accomplish complex, multi-step
workflows.

### Rapid Prototyping

Go from idea to working automation in minutes. The intuitive interface makes it
simple to draft, test, and refine your agents without any coding knowledge.

## How It Works

### Creating an Agent

1. **Define Agent's Goal**\
   Start with a clear objective written in plain language. The AI understands
   what you want to achieve.

2. **Choose Your Model**\
   Select from available AI models or define a custom one to power your agent.

3. **Connect Tools**\
   Add the tools your agent needs - integrations that enable real-world actions.

4. **Design Workflow Steps**\
   Outline the process with simple steps. No need to pass parameters between
   steps (nodes).

5. **Run**\
   Launch immediately or schedule for later. Your agent works autonomously in
   the cloud.
