# Bluerage

Mobile first AI-powered automation that thinks and acts for you. Create workflows that run in the background, connecting your favorite tools and services.

## What is Bluerage?

Bluerage transforms automation by combining the simplicity of visual workflows with the intelligence of AI. Think of it as Apple Shortcuts enhanced with AI capabilities - create agents that understand your goals, make decisions, and execute complex tasks autonomously in the cloud.

## Key Features

### Mobile First
Designed from the ground up for iOS. Share content directly to your agents, trigger workflows on the go, and manage automations from anywhere with a native mobile experience.

### Bring Your Own Keys
Full control over your AI usage and costs. Connect your own API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, or other providers.

### Declarative Automation
Define your goal in natural language and let AI handle the complexity. Your agents understand context, make decisions, and passes data between steps for you. No node-based architecture!

### Cloud-Based Execution
Agents run in the cloud via Convex, continuing their work even after you close the app. Start a task and come back to see the results.

### Tool Integration
Connect your existing applications and services through a growing library of tools. Each agent can access multiple tools to accomplish complex, multi-step workflows.

### Rapid Prototyping
Go from idea to working automation in minutes. The intuitive interface makes it simple to draft, test, and refine your agents without any coding knowledge.

## How It Works

### Creating an Agent

1. **Define Your Goal**  
   Start with a clear objective written in plain language. The AI understands what you want to achieve.

2. **Choose Your Model**  
   Select from available AI models or define a custom one to power your agent's intelligence and decision-making.

3. **Connect Tools**  
   Add the tools your agent needs - APIs, services, and integrations that enable real-world actions.

4. **Design Workflow Steps**  
   Outline the process with simple steps. The AI fills in the details and handles edge cases.

5. **Deploy and Run**  
   Launch immediately or schedule for later. Your agent works autonomously in the cloud.
